2008 January 2

Initial release, version 1.0.

2008 October 12

Fixed ISBN-13 check digit computation whose correct ISBN-10
check digit was zero.

2015 October 6

Added generation of Amazon links with credit to a primary or
alternative associate account.  Version 1.1.

2017 October 10

Added configuration for primary and alternative Amazon accounts
and Web sites either within the program or by command line
options.  Version 1.2.

2017 October 23

Added Library of Congress algorithm for hyphenation of ISBNs.
Version 1.3.

2018 October 18

Began development of version 1.4.

The main focus of 1.4 is the replacement of the ad hoc
hyphenation code for ISBNs derived from a U.S. Library of
Congress page which may be good enough for government work but
doesn't meet Fourmilab's standards.  It's just a regular
expression hack which handles only a fraction of the actual ISBN
registration groups and their particular ranges for separating
registrant and publication numbers.

The new code imports the authoritative database from the keepers
of ISBN in XML form from:
    https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation
(There isn't a direct download link; you have to select XML
format from the form on this page and then download.)

The XML file is processed with a new Perl program,
parse_range_xml.pl, which compiles it into a Perl array
definition in isbn_range.pl which is then included in the
development version of isbniser.pl with a do statement.

This array is then used by a completely rewritten hyphenate()
function, which has the same calling sequence of the previous
version, but handles every case of ISBN defined by the master
table.

Separating the processing of the XML table into an independent
Perl program means that isbniser itself is not dependent on the
Perl module XML::Parser (which parse_range_xml.pl requires).
This preserves the ability of isbniser to run out of the box on
a "bare metal" Perl installation without any optional modules.

Using the master ISBN database allows identification of the ISBN
registration group by name.  A new "-g" option displays this
along with the interpreted ISBN information.

The ISBN range database is kept separate from the source code of
isbniser.pl for maintenance reasons, but to preserve the easy
installation of the program in a directory on a user's PATH, I
added a new utility, makemono.pl, which constructs a monolithic
isbniser executable in which the database is embedded.  All of
this is done automatically by the Makefile when the distribution
archive is prepared.  All the user need do is copy isbniser into
a directory on the PATH and it just works: no dependencies,
support files, or module installations are required.

The calculation of ISBN-13 check digits by ISBN_13_check() would
return a value of 10 if the check digit sum modulo 10 came out
zero.  It forgot to perform a second mod 10 operation to map a
sum of 10 into 0.  Because validate_ISBN_13() has its own
validation algorithm which doesn't directly compute the check
digit, it was not affected, so this only caused problems when
generating ISBN-13 values from ISBN-10 arguments.  It's fixed
now.

Updated the "make check" sequence to test both the development
(isbniser.pl) and production (isbniser) programs.

Updated "make lint" to test both the development and production
programs.

Updated "make dist" to force a re-build of isbn_range.pl and
isbniser before creating the distribution archive.

2018 October 22

Updated the CSS validation link in index.html so it works if the
document is accessed via a https: URL.

Built the version 1.4 distribution for release.

2018 October 30

Downloaded an update ISBN Range database and integrated
into the program.  There were some changes for the French
language and Iran registration groups.

2018 October 31

Integrated the code from the version developed for use by
ISBNquest to support the "-d" option for CSV format output.

Added test cases to the Makefile "make check" target to test CSV
format output.

2018 November 2

Added this file (log.txt) to the distribution archive.

Built the version 1.5 distribution for release.

2020 May 8

Began development of version 1.6.

Downloaded the latest ISBN Range database in XML.  This version
is dated 2020-05-06 and updates the database used in 1.5,
which was dated 2018-10-30.  The differences are relatively
minor, affecting agency declarations for:
    Benin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Estonia, Kenya, Malta,
    Mongolia, North Macedonia, Sri Lanka, Turkey,
    United States, Uruguay
The previous agency for Macedonia was deleted and replaced with
North Macedonia.

Prepared version 1.6 for release.

2021 October 27

Downloaded the latest ISBN Range database in XML.  This version is
dated 2021-10-27 and updates the database used in 1.6, which was dated
2020-05-06.  The differences are intermediate in scope, affecting
agency declarations for:
    Argentina, Benin, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Colombia, Ecuador, English
    language, Ghana, Guatemala, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Luxembourg,
    Macau, Malaysia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Pakistan,
    Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Taiwan,
    Tajikistan, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, United States, ia

Created Git repository, committed the version 1.7 files.

Logged on to github.com.

Created a new repository:
    isbniser
with access URLs:
    HTTPS: https://github.com/Fourmilab/isbniser.git
    SSH:   git@github.com:Fourmilab/isbniser.git

Linked the local repository to the GitHub archive:
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Fourmilab/isbniser.git

Prepared version 1.7 for release.
